# Clustering and classification

This week we are practising with a Boston data from the MASS package. First lets load the data and observe the structure and dimensions of it:

```{r  fig.width=5, fig.height=4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# accessing the data

library(MASS)
data("boston")

# structure and dimensions
str(Boston)
dim(Boston)


```


The data describes housing values in suburbs of boston and it has 506 observations and 14 variables. The meanings of each individual variable can be found through this link: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/Boston.html.
